									Hi my name is Nick Bedford and welcome to my portfolio!
									I am a video games programmer with a passion for creating and playing video games. I have always enjoyed video games and ever since I embarked upon a career in the games industry I have endeavoured to make a lasting impression on whatever project I work on. Here is a link to some of the <a href="#work">work</a> I have made at university and during my own time if you would like to view it.

								<h3>Utility AI</h3>

									As part of my own research into both AI and Unreal Engine 5 I created a flexible utility based AI system. This system worked by assigning actions to a given AI controller which would decide which action to do based on the highest scoring action. The core system of the AI was developed using C++ and the gameplay elements seen in the video were developed using Unreal Engine's Blueprint system.

								<p>During the team project I acted as the team leader, primary gameplay and primary AI programmer. During the earlier stages of the project I created team documents such as the coding standard and a design document. During the project: I created the Pickup class and it's derived classes, created the CaptureArea class and optimised the derived classes, created the framework for a collision callback system, added the fixed world patitioning, added a type system to physics nodes, created a clean up phase which removed objects from the game, created the state and behaviour systems for the AI, assisted with the creation of the minion class, created the path smoothing functionality, assisted all team members with debugging code and advised changes during code reviews.</p>

								<h3>Rapid Prototyping in Unreal</h3>

									As part of my team project I was tasked with a rapid prototype of a game based on De Blob. This prototype was primarily to test if the game produced engaging split screen gameplay. This game was completed in five days with the following features:
									A menu system, split screen, movable camera, painting the environment with decals, capturing point on the environment after painting them enough, win/loss condition, restartable, pickups, rubber banding (unlimited ammo and super spray last longer if you are on the losing side), a spray weapon, a paint rocket weapon, a HUD featuring: time remaining, ammo count, a score in the form of a bar and a minimap.

								<h3>Advanced Game Tech</h3>

								</div>

								<p>As a part of the physics module I was shown other techniques which feature in games primarily AI and networking. This project is an example of a server running a maze generator, A* pathfinding with string pulling and hierarchical, data-driven finite state machines for five agents with all necessary data for rendering being sent to the clients. All commands for generating/regenerating the maze, moving the start and end paths and spawning the player are all sent from the clients.</p>

								</div>

								<p>In this module I was taught multiple techniques for physics programming. This coursework required me to create some scenes in order to show my understanding of the taught material such as simulating 3D Newtonian physics and broad phase culling using dynamic octrees. This project expanded upon the graphics module so C++ was used and CUDA for the GPU ball pool.</p>

								</div>

								<p>In this module I was introduced to different techniques for graphics programming. This coursework required me to create three scenes of my choosing to show off certain aspects of graphics programming. A display of three different scenes using deferred rendering to produce the Phong lighting model in each scene. Objects in the scenes are all managed in the program utilising a scene graph. Other graphical features shown in the video are: Cube mapping, water reflection, real time shadows, index buffering of a height map, post processing particle effects utilising geometry shaders. This project was written in C++ and OpenGL building on the already established framework.</p>

								<p>This was a personal project which evolved into my final year dissertation of my undergraduate degree. In this project two teams of AI face each other in a 3D game of capture the flag. The white team uses an AI which does not take teammates information into their decision making, where as the black team utilises each others information e.g. who has the flag, which enemies can be see etc. Both AIs use a behaviour tree and blackboard, the black team also use a custom class called team sight which manages which opponents can and can not be see. This project was created in Unreal Engine 4 using some C++ but mostly Unreal's native blueprint system.</p>

								<h3>Domination AI</h3>

								<p>In this project two teams of AI face each other in a 2D game of domination. The blue team uses an extremely basic AI which goes to a capture point, shoots enemies if ammo is available or if out of ammo go to the reload point. The red team's decisions are based on a finite state machine with multiple states (As shown in the top left of the screen for each red bot). The red teams decision to go get ammo is dictated by fuzzy logic based on the distance from the closest enemy and their ammo count. The red team also uses A* to pathfind around the map with path following optimisations akin to string pulling. The nodes used by the A* algorithm are generated on map loading using a quad tree, allowing any map to be created and the AI would still be able to path find around the map.</p>
